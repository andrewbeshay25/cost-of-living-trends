          <StoryParagraph text="Let's start by zooming in on one city. Over the past several years, rents (red) have often outpaced median household incomes (blue). When rents rise faster than incomes, families face an increased cost burden that can limit their financial freedom. Hover over either line to see which metric you're examining." />
